Web Reader - a COVID-19 Data Gatherer
---------------

Gets data from a coronavirus database and webscraps it using Python.
Outputs the results as text.
Database: https://ncov2019.live/data

Uses BeautifulSoup package to get the HTML and formats it.

Initially based off of a HackClub Workshop.
However, the code was really broken due to all the HTML tables having different spacing than before.
